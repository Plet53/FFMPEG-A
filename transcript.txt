Hello, My name is Andrew Reade, from Phoenix, Arizona, in the US of A, and this is a demonstration of FFMPEG-A, an (attempted) interface for the FFMPEG libraries, for android. Now, the menu I've built here is designed to be as simple to use as possbile. Simply select a preset, choose whether we're going to keep audio, or not, select an input video, create your output video, and watch as the app does... Nothing!

Well no okay so, not exactly. See, when you select an input video, and your phone is connected to an adb console, the system outputs metadata about the video file, and any video and audio streams inside of it. The core reason that this doesn't work is that, Android denies access to the video hardware that ffmpeg needs in order to encode video. There's a much more detailed write up of the program at the github link in the description, as well as the complete source for the project. In any case, this was, CS50x, and, Thank you for watching.
